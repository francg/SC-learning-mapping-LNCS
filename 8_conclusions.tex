The mapping of the literature was challenging because this is an emerging field, rather fragmented and characterized by a terminology that has not yet stabilized. Also, compared with other research fields that have developed more standardized ways to formulate abstracts, in this field the quality of the abstracts varies. Consequently, it varies the quality and quantity of information that can be extracted. Being aware of these challenges, we have combined manual and automatic searches of the literature to assure the coverage of a significant portion of relevant literature. We have also carefully analyzed abstracts to extract as much information as possible. 

As part of our future research we aim at performing systematic literature reviews to shed light on the identified gaps. At the same time, we are also starting our design activities towards the development of a framework for supporting design and development of applications for smart city learning.
