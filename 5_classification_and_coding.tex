A first classification structure was drafted and used by one of the authors to code the first 20 abstracts. The coding of these abstracts and the classification were then discussed and revised by both authors.

The classification structure was created in Nvivo\footnote{http://www.qsrinternational.com/} and was organized in two nested levels.

The authors decided to use an \textit{emerging} approach when working on the categories: new elements were dynamically added during the coding process.

The coding process itself consisted in reading the abstract and \textit{tagging} relevant chunks of text with one or more categories.

The number of categories that could be correlated to any single publication was strictly connected with the richness and accuracy of the abstract. More information-rich and structured abstracts were tagged with more categories than shorter ones.
