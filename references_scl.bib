  abstract = {The concept of Smart City (SC) as a means to enhance the life quality of citizen has been gaining increasing importance in the agendas of policy makers. However, a shared definition of SC is not available and it is hard to identify common global trends. This paper provides with a comprehensive understanding of the notion of SC through the elaboration of a taxonomy of pertinent application domains, namely: natural resources and energy, transport and mobility, buildings, living, government, and economy and people. It also explores the diffusion of smart initiatives via an empirical study aimed at investigating the ratio of domains covered by a city's best practices to the total of potential domains of smart initiatives and at understanding the role that various economic, urban, demographic, and geographical variables might have in influencing the planning approach to create a smarter city. Results reveal that the evolution patterns of a SC highly depend on its local context factors. In particular, economic development and structural urban variables are likely to influence a city's digital path, the geographical location to affect the SC strategy, and density of population, with its associated congestion problems, might an important component to determine the routes for the SC implementation. This work provides policy makers and city managers with useful guidelines to define and drive their SC strategy and planning actions towards the most appropriate domains of implementation.},

  abstract = {At the turn of the century some cities and regions in Europe, Japan and the USA, displayed an exceptional capacity to incubate and develop new knowledge and innovations. The favourable environment for research, technology and innovation created in these areas was not immediately obvious, yet it was of great significance for a development based on knowledge, learning, and innovation. Intelligent Cities focuses on these environments of innovation, and the major models (technopoles, innovating regions, intelligent cities) for creating an environment-supporting technology, innovation, learning, and knowledge-based development.The introduction and the first chapter deal with innovation as an environmental condition, and with the geography and typology of islands of innovation. The next three parts focus on the theoretical paradigms and the planning models of the 'industrial district', the innovating region', and the 'intelligent city', which offer three alternative ways to create an environment of innovation.},

  abstract = {Debates about the future of urban development in many Western countries have been increasingly influenced by discussions of smart cities. Yet despite numerous examples of this `urban labelling' phenomenon, we know surprisingly little about so-called smart cities, particularly in terms of what the label ideologically reveals as well as hides. Due to its lack of definitional precision, not to mention an underlying self-congratulatory tendency, the main thrust of this article is to provide a preliminary critical polemic against some of the more rhetorical aspects of smart cities. The primary focus is on the labelling process adopted by some designated smart cities, with a view to problematizing a range of elements that supposedly characterize this new urban form, as well as question some of the underlying assumptions/contradictions hidden within the concept. To aid this critique, the article explores to what extent labelled smart cities can be understood as a high-tech variation of the `entrepreneurial city', as well as speculates on some general principles which would make them more progressive and inclusive.},

  abstract = {The concept of Smart City embraces several definitions depending on the meanings of the word {\textquotedblleft}smart{\textquotedblright}: intelligent city , knowledge city , ubiquitous city , sustainable city , digital city , etc. Many definitions of Smart City exist, but no one has been universally acknowledged yet. From literature analysis it emerges that Smart City and Digital City are the most used terminologies in literature to indicate the smartness of a city. This Chapter explores the literature about Smart City and Digital City from 1993 to the end of 2012 in order to investigate how these two concepts were born, how they have developed, which are the shared features and differences between them. To accomplish with these goals, three steps were followed: (1) to set up a search strategy for systematic literature review to collect a representative subset of papers about Smart City and Digital City using Google Scholar; (2) to store the selected subset in an ad-doc database to synthesize the literature review; (3) to organize the literature review subset to extract quantitative and qualitative data and information about Smart City and Digital City evolution. The author proposes a literature review taxonomy through five specific analysis: (1) time analysis, to explore the causes of the trend of Smart City and Digital City literature in the latest twenty years; (2) terminology analysis, to examine how and where these two ideas were born and what have been the main events influenced their development; (3) definitions analysis, to select and compare the most cited and validated definitions of Smart City and Digital City trying to identify similarities, differences or overlaps between these two concepts; (4) typology analysis, to investigate if Smart City and Digital City are included into a specific urban strategy pursued by government or if they face specific urban problems without a comprehensive framework; (5) geographic analysis, to understand where are the largest concentrations of Smart Cities and Digital Cities in the world and which are their main characteristics and best practices.},

In each case, we cite empirical literature to show that the claims are overstated and that some of the educational implications that have been taken from these claims are misguided.},

Poor reporting of systematic reviews diminishes their value to clinicians, policy makers, and other users.Since the development of the QUOROM (QUality Of Reporting Of Meta-analysis) Statement{\textemdash}a reporting guideline published in 1999{\textemdash}there have been several conceptual, methodological, and practical advances regarding the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Also, reviews of published systematic reviews have found that key information about these studies is often poorly reported. Realizing these issues, an international group that included experienced authors and methodologists developed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) as an evolution of the original QUOROM guideline for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of evaluations of health care interventions.The PRISMA Statement consists of a 27-item checklist and a four-phase flow diagram. The checklist includes items deemed essential for transparent reporting of a systematic review. In this Explanation and Elaboration document, we explain the meaning and rationale for each checklist item. For each item, we include an example of good reporting and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies and methodological literature. The PRISMA Statement, this document, and the associated Web site (www.prisma-statement.org) should be helpful resources to improve reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.},

Urban laboratories are emerging in numerous cities around the world as a strategy for local governments to partner with public and private property owners to reduce carbon emissions, while simultaneously stimulating economic growth. In this article, we use insights from laboratory studies to analyse the notion of urban laboratories as they relate to experimental governance, the carbonization agenda and the transition to low-carbon economies. We present a case study of the Oxford Road corridor in Manchester in the UK that is emerging as a low-carbon urban laboratory, with important policy implications for the city's future. The corridor is a bounded space where a public-private partnership comprised of the City Council, two universities and other large property owners is redeveloping the physical infrastructure and installing monitoring equipment to create a recursive feedback loop intended to facilitate adaptive learning. This low-carbon urban laboratory represents a classic sustainable development formula for coupling environmental protection with economic growth, using innovation and partnership as principal drivers. However, it also has significant implications in reworking the interplay of knowledge production and local governance, while reinforcing spatial differentiation and uneven participation in urban development.},

They can enable learning when the user is en-gaged in everyday activities while out and about, complementing formal language classes. A significant challenge, however, has been the practical implementation of services that can accurately identify and make use of context, particularly location, to offer meaningful language learning recommendations to users. In this paper we review a range of approaches to identifying context to support mobile language learning. We consider how dynamically changing aspects of context may influence the quality of recommendations presented to a user. We introduce the MASELTOV project's use of context awareness combined with a rules-based recommendation engine to present suitable learning content to recent immigrants in urban areas; a group that may benefit from contextual support and can use the city as a learning environment.},

The game was called "B3-Design your Marketplace!" The B3 game aims to provide a playful digital environment in which the citizens gain information about the current situation in the city district, have the possibility of submitting their own designs for the marketplace, vote for the preferred designs, and chat with the experts and other participants. The prototype of the B3 serious game was evaluated with a group of students and a group of elderly people. The majority of the participants involved in testing expressed appreciation for the digital serious game as a new form of online civic engagement in urban planning. The paper concludes with a discussion about the potential of digital serious games for civic engagement and open research questions.},

It highlights examples of modeling innovative practice through research and teaching with emergent technologies in a frame of Let's play as architects in the city! project launched in 2012 as optional subject-matter for the third and fourth grade of elementary school. Developed by a group of architects (Grupul De-a arhitectura) and implemented in partnership with the University of Bucharest and Architects' Order, the project has an interdisciplinary approach and involves architects, teachers and University faculty and students. Project aims to make primary school students acquainted with basic concepts from architecture and urbanism by direct observation, neighborhood exploration and creative use of data gathered through a variety of ICT tools. Firstly the paper explores young students' textual engagements with mobile technologies and the changing nature of literacy in the context of being involved in an engaging complex activity. Project activities provide contextual learning experiences and rich exploration and discovery of the connected nature of information in the real world. Specific assignments reinforce skills development, use of mobile technologies and articulation to school curriculum: reading, writing, math, technological education, civic participation, arts and digital skills. Secondly the paper investigates the perceptions of learning facilitators' on the use of mobile technology for project implementation. Architects and teachers will provide narrative information on the balance between planned and unplanned in using new technology for classroom and outdoor activities with elementary school students, between types of emerging collaboration encouraged by use of mobile technologies. Instructors will reflect not only on strengths but also on the challenges in implementing this integrative learning approach. Thirdly, the evaluation of project implementation during the pilot phase will allow changes aiming at making of the extended phase a platform of quality education. Experiences gained in the frame of Let's play as architects in the city! could provide genuine examples about ubiquitous learning, where learning opportunities and experiences are dramatically changing (Burbules). Therefore we expect to stimulate research efforts that focus on key areas like mobile learning, new literacies (e-texts) and engaging faculty and students in the pursuit of digital perspectives to research and teaching.},

  abstract = {Disaster occurrence around the world has in the past few decades increased at an alarming rate necessitating an urgent need for mitigation strategies. As a result, research has indicated the usefulness of Information Communication Technology (ICT) in disaster risk management. Furthermore, ICT generally plays a critical role in all aspects of disaster risk management such as: early warning prediction; informing and circulating information relating to disasters to communities especially those at risk as promptly as possible and providing communication structures immediately after a disaster occurrence. As part of its planning and precautionary measures in responding to disasters, the City of Cape Town Disaster Risk Management Centre (CoCTDRMC) implements public awareness programmes across the city. The most acclaimed is an annual awareness programme especially for high school learners selected from various schools across the city. The learner participants are expected to act as change agents in their communities. In 2012, learners from twelve different schools across the city benefited from this programme. They were expected to educate families, friends, schoolmates and communities generally on the topical issues surrounding disaster risk management. This study uses a case study approach. Since the target audience of the programme is the youth, there is need to shift towards utilising ICT. The aim of this paper is to look at how e-learning as an ICT tool can be integrated in the implementation of Public Awareness Education Programme (PAEP), so as to target broader audience and create an increased capacity building across the City of Cape Town (CoCT). The examination considers providing tools that are accessible, dependable, resilient and flexible among the residents so as to reach the grassroots levels where communities are mostly affected. The paper considers a combination of tools so as to support behavioural change. Some of the research findings are that, the 2012 programme was very beneficial and successful. Henceforth there is need to target a broader audience, and although the CoCTDRMC does make use of some relevant ICTs, there is need for additional and upgraded technological resources. Also pertinent is the fact that e-learning can play a major role in making sure that a broader audience is reached if applied effectively. The findings of the research are of relevance to the CoCTDRMC and other municipalities across South Africa. The Centre for Innovative Educational and Communication Technologies (CIECT) at the University of the Western Cape can also use these findings to develop and implement an e-learning course for both employees of CoCTDRMC and other interested community members. This will guide them on how e-learning can assist in fostering a successful implementation of PAEP across the city.},

  title = {Outdoors {Virtual} {Museum}},
  abstract = {The information era is evident in the implementation of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) in schools. ICT may be used to collect information, organize it, store and share it, thereby mediating between students and world phenomena. On the verge of the 21st century we are witnessing the emergence of paperless schools, e.g. schools that utilize digital books, notebooks and virtual labs as a substitute for paper books, notebooks and physical labs. Accordingly, students deal mostly, not with the physical world, but rather with its representation. This creates a parallel world, rather than a merging of the two worlds: the virtual and the physical. This may be linked to the core notion of Vygotsky's cultural-historical activity theory, which states that individuals do not act directly within the environment, but rather artifacts mediate relationships with objects in the physical world {[}1]. Hence, tools, as well as ICT applications and the Internet itself, may serve as artifacts, which facilitate higher order skills and thus mediate learning in schools and beyond. Engestrom {[}2] argues against the separation between schooling and other learning experiences; he refers to it as the encapsulation of school learning. To overcome this encapsulation, he offers emphasis on the role of mediating artifacts in human cognition and learning. Environmental programs, being international in nature, may combine real-world experiences with ICT. According to Vygotsky's cultural-historical activity theory, educational design and evaluation, whether in-class or with relation to the virtual environment, should reflect cultural-historical aspects of human activity. Effects of these programs should include indicators measuring sustainable changes {[}3]. The project described herewith, "Outdoors Virtual Museum" was designed in the spirit of the cultural-historical activity theory. A section of the Tel Aviv coast (Israel), where Levinsky College of Education and Alterman High School are both located, includes a natural wild area with a sandstone ridge and a wetland with some vernal ponds. It is the habitat of several species of plants and animals, some rare and endangered. This region is planned to undergo massive development as part of the city plan high-rise buildings for housing, roads, shopping malls and entertainment quarters. The project goals are to promote an activist-ecological agenda and to facilitate authentic learning in a technology-rich environment. Hence, by highlighting the natural value of the area, we achieve enhanced awareness among students, all of which are Tel-Aviv residents. The project involves 7th grade students and college education students documenting the nature life of the environment and changes due to the development process planned by the municipality. College and High school students, together with an ecologist and their science and science education teachers, toured the area several times and designed 7 stations representing diverse ecological niches. The exact locations were pinpointed using Google Earth. Each stop was then visited once a month by a group of students, measuring temperature and shadowing, and taking photos of the area, and documenting animals and plants. Each location was accompanied by a website constructed for displaying information, including photos. Websites were constructed using Google Sites by the students and updated on a monthly basis. In each physical location a QR code was incorporated, allowing visitors to access information on the websites. This project tackles the encapsulation of school learning by using ICT tools to mediate between the environment and the students. The added value of the product is the exposure of data and information within the community, as the QR-codes in the real world are in open spaces. Allowing their scanning and entering the web pages by all community members.},

The computer-supported collaborative learning environment was used to support the participants' collaborative design activties. The main research question: What kind of design learning processes and environmental competence will emerge during the project? Sixth graders (n=29) designed 7 apartment buildings of several types, for a building site planned by the City of Helsinki. The project lasted one half year and integrated with many school subjects. The participants' quantitative contributions to the database were analyzed, and futher, the qualitative content analysis was conducted on the students' notes. For the deeper analysis, we selected notes that were related to 1) analysis of the neighborhood, 2) constructing design context, and 3) reflection on the project -notes, which we took to represent participants' "learning outcome" The results revealed that, according to the evidence we obtained, students gained in several aspects of awareness and environmental competence related to architectural concepts and principles.

Desk research by way of literature search has been applied on projects in three countries. The results of the empirical studies have shown three problems in the collaborative environment: semantics, synchronisation and communication. Besides these handicaps, there are professional handicaps. The article sketches a scenario for a virtual environment for collaborative learning with network technology and simulation games. This will lead to a filter mediated interaction model. The scenario is illustrated with three screenshots of the interface. Practical, professional tools, based on the methodology and the mock-up, will be developed in an international effort.},

The objectives of the paper are to generate insights into how mobile game-based learning in secondary education affects pupils' knowledge: of medieval Amsterdam, their motivation for History and for the subject of Middle Ages, and their attitude towards collaborative learning. We investigated the effects of a game called Frequency 1550. Frequency 1550 is a mobile city game developed by the Waag Society in which pupils playfully acquire historical knowledge about the medieval city of Amsterdam. A quasi-experimental design is followed in which data have been gathered on the process of gaming and learning of 458 pupils from twenty classes of five schools. Qualitative and quantitative data have been gathered. In this paper the focus will be on the quantitative data. Pupils of ten classes played the mobile history game, whereas the other pupils followed regular project-based lesson series (control condition) especially designed for this project in strong co-operation with five History teachers from the participating schools. The results show that, on average, pupils of the game received higher scores on the knowledge test on facts about medieval Amsterdam than pupils who followed regular project-based lessons. No significant differences were found between the groups regarding narrative knowledge, motivation for History and for the subject of Middle Ages, and attitude towards collaborative learning.},

Through the lens of what we term the paradigms of technology and cutting-edge content as an educational end, means, and equalizer, we explore how learning about Big Data with mobile technologies exists at the critical intersection of issues such as the purpose of schooling, global competitiveness, corporate profit, student agency, and democratic participation. These competing interests surface tensions at the classroom, institutional, and societal levels. Engaging these tensions, we offer a framework of student objectives for learning about Big Data with mobile technologies. Through a reflection on the challenges we continue to encounter as we attempt to implement innovative curriculum within the constraints of urban public schools, we hope to prompt dialogue and changes in practice with respect to what it means to learn for democratic participation using Big Data. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.},

Developing a sense of ownership at the local community level in a strategic collaboration with the university body and technical schools is the key for the success of projects. In addition to the technology development, this paper also points to the importance of the mutual learning platform for information dissemination of development across economic sectors driven by MicroGrid technologies. This platform will offer RD advancements in various other technologies focused on energy sustainability. Our evaluation suggests that many of these technologies integrated even at MicroGrid powered levels such as a patent pending solar thermal/Fischer Tropsh system which can provide an efficiency of service beyond rural communities to include large urban centers. This paper will attempt to show that the proposed platform can serve as the drivers for efficient municipal town planning systems, resource management and as human resource growth catalyst. Several models based on previous publications around the development of modified micro grids are discussed to illustrate additional possibilities. These platforms are envisioned as primary building blocks for future system expansion. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Two Business case studies in University Laboratories on learning and mobility present the opportunity to experiment new multimedia data management, data analysis, distributed collaboration. Software engineering practices based on cloud technology techniques acquire from the Web what is needed for rapid prototyping, capability of satisfying the needs of customers, market validation of pricing policies, marketing strategies. As an alternative to standard software engineering programming, this approach allows to specify the projects' concepts by reaching stakeholders of needed ICT components to implement a prototype relying on SW components available elsewhere. Two sample cases clarify this cloud-engineering approach to the development innovation: 1) Program for Recovery Insufficient Grades in High- School (PRISC); 2) Social Mobility (SM) to reduce dependence on owned cars to satisfy mobility needs. The PRISC strategy is to focus on the learner and on how proficiency is assessed through grades. The action steps: 1) understanding is focused on the students' study on schoolbooks; 2) assessment is delegated to exercises and tests managed in interactive Web environment on screens of mobile telephones or PCs; 3) students with excellent grades act as tutors by exploiting the social networks. The SM strategy focuses on exploiting the empty seats available in most cars in metropolitan cities with air pollution problems. Key features: 1) direct negotiation via mobile devices between car drivers and ride seekers; 2) short range contacts insuring prompt satisfaction; 3) GPS ride surveillance. {\textcopyright} 2011 by Knowledge Systems Institute Graduate School.},

  abstract = {A mobile and multimedia game designed for History education was analyzed in terms of how it is designed and how it was applied as a narrative learning environment. In History education, narrative can be argued to be very useful to overcome fragmentation of the knowledge of historical characters and events, by relating these with meaningful connections of temporality and sequence (storification). In the game studied, students explore the history of Amsterdam by walking in the city, experiencing characters, buildings, and events, while using UMTS/GPS phones for communication and exchange of information. The History game was played during one day by 216 students, spread over 10 secondary school classes, in groups of four or five students. All information exchanged during the games was collected, and the game play and introduction of the game was observed by team coaches and researchers. The design of the game as well as the actual gaming process was analyzed with respect to how it evoked three types of storification: receiving (spectator), constructing (director) and participating in (actor) the story. Results show that the game evoked a mixture of these three types of storification. Moreover, these types of storification processes differently affected students' engagement. Participating in the story evoked high activity in the game but less awareness of the whole story, whereas constructing the story triggered awareness of the whole story. Compared to receiving the story, both these types positively affected the engagement of the students being active and motivated during the game. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Much information is inherently coupled with a certain place. Accessing this information at the given place is often the key to understand it or at least it helps understanding the information much better than accessing it elsewhere. e-Learning systems free the learners from the chains of time and place. However they are normally used with PCs or laptop computers either at home or at certain premises. Especially in a city like Trier, which is full of history, it is easy to verify that learning about the Romans and seeing a picture of a historic site is different to the real world experience of this site. This reflection leads us to the idea to extend the capabilities of a conventional E-learning system in a way that information can be accessed where it can be understood more easily, i.e. on its place. Therefore we have extended the system MOVII (Moving Images and Interfaces), which is a flexible and visually appealing E-learning Platform with a possibility to geocode information entities and to access them appropriately.},

This experimental design was situated within the theory of pedagogical praxis, which suggests that modeling learning environments on authentic professional practices enables youth to develop a deeper understanding of important domains of inquiry (Shaffer, 2004). Results presented here suggest that through participation in the project students: a) developed an understanding of ecology; and b) developed this understanding through the urban planning practices and the features of the GIS model used during the project. Thus, we propose that this augmented by reality learning environment modeled on the professional practices of urban planners extends the theory of pedagogical praxis into the domain of ecology and offers a useful method for developing ecological understanding through participation in simulations that incorporate the authentic tools and practices of urban planning. {\textcopyright} 2005, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.},
