\subsection{Data Sources}
The articles were searched and collected using three different approaches:

\begin{enumerate}
\item keyword based search on different online databases
\item manual screening of selected conference proceedings
\item manual screening of selected special issues of journals
\end{enumerate}

The following online databases were used for the keyword based search: ISI Web of Science\footnote{https://apps.webofknowledge.com/}, ACM digital library\footnote{https://dl.acm.org/}, Elsevier - ScienceDirect\footnote{https://www.sciencedirect.com/}, Elsevier - Scopus\footnote{http://www.scopus.com/}, IEEE Xplore\footnote{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/}.

\medskip

The following conference proceedings were searched for relevant articles:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{CSCW} Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing\footnote{http://cscw.acm.org/}
\item \textbf{CHI} Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems\footnote{http://chiYYYY.acm.org/}
\item \textbf{EC-TEL} European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning\footnote{http://www.ec-tel.eu/}
\item \textbf{AMI} International Joint Conference on Ambient Intelligence\footnote{http://www.ami-conferences.org/}
\item \textbf{C\&T} International Conference on Communities and Technologies\footnote{http://comtech.community/}
\end{itemize}

The following journal issues were searched for relevant articles:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{IJDLDC} International Journal of Digital Literacy and Digital Competence vol. 3 n. 4 - Special Issue on \textit{``Smart City Learning, literacy and Competences''}\footnote{http://www.igi-global.com/journal/international-journal-digital-literacy-digital/1170}
\item \textbf{IxD\&A} Interaction Design and Architecture(s), vol. 16 (part I)\footnote{\url{http://www.mifav.uniroma2.it/inevent/events/idea2010/index.php?s=10&a=10&link=ToC_16_P}}, vol. 17 (part II)\footnote{\url{http://www.mifav.uniroma2.it/inevent/events/idea2010/index.php?s=10&a=10&link=ToC_17_P}} - Special Issue on \textit{``Smart City Learning - Visions and practical Implementations: toward Horizon 2020''} 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Search and Keywords}
The keywords selection process was driven by the PICO framework. PICO helps to develop a comprehensive set of search keywords for quantitative research terms according to: Population, Intervention or Exposure (PECO), Comparison, Outcomes\cite{schardt_utilization_2007}.

Initially, keywords for all the sections of the framework were selected, but the authors decided later on to relax some constraints in order to avoid missing some possible relevant articles. A \textit{context} section was also added to the schema.

Table \ref{table:keywords} shows the PICO(C) structure with associated keywords.

\textbf{Intervention} & \textit{learning} \\ \hline
\textbf{Comparison} & \textit{-} \\ \hline
\textbf{Outcome} & \textit{\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}participation, collaboration, reflection,\\ awareness\end{tabular}} \\ \hline
\textbf{Context} & \textit{\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}cities, smart city, urban, connected city,\\ intelligent city, digital city\end{tabular}} \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

A pilot search was conducted on some of the online databases in order to refine the keywords and find a search query that could be adapted and used in all the different online databases.

The final search query used is reported in Table \ref{table:query}.

 & \textbf{AND} \\
\rowcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF} 
\textbf{Intervention} & ("learning") \\
 & \textbf{AND} \\
\rowcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF} 
\textbf{Outcome} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}(participation OR collaboration\\ OR reflection OR awareness)\end{tabular}
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Different online databases offer different levels of search functionalities and details when going to use a complex query that possibly involves several keywords and fields (title, abstract, etc.).

Some of the difficulties encountered were:
\begin{itemize}
\item limit on the number of keywords that can be used;
\item limit on the fields where the search can be performed, search on title AND abstract not always possible;
\item no precise and direct control on the target search fields, keywords could be only searched on a preset aggregation of fields like title, abstract, article keywords;
\item different ways of coding the same logic expression, the same search string couldn't be reused on different databases;
\item different formats of the result set, in some cases was possible to batch-download the results, otherwise results had been scraped using Zotero\footnote{https://www.zotero.org/} browser integration.
\end{itemize}

The keywords were searched on title and abstract when possible, otherwise only the abstract was used. In Table \ref{table:result_1} the size of the result sets for each online database are outlined.

The articles collected were imported in a Zotero library, and duplicates were manually removed.
